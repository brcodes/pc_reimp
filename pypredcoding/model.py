    def train(self, X, Y, save_checkpoint=None, plot=False):
        '''
        Trains the model using input images and labels, with options for checkpointing and plotting.

        Parameters:
            X (np.array): Input images, shape=(num_imgs, numxpxls * numypxls) [non-tiled] or 
                          (num_imgs * numtlsperimg, numtlxpxls * numtlypxls) [tiled].
            Y (np.array): Labels, shape=(num_imgs, num_classes).
            save_checkpoint (None or dict, optional): Controls checkpoint saving behavior. None to save only the final model. 
                                            Dict can have keys 'save_every' with int value N to save every N epochs, 
                                             or 'fraction' with float value 1/N to save every 1/N * Tot epochs.
            plot (bool, optional): If True, plot loss and accuracy.

        Notes:
            - Epoch 0 (initialized, untrained) model is always saved. (models/checkpoints/)
            - Final model is always saved. (models/)
            - Saving any model also saves a log.

    def evaluate(self, X, Y, plot=None):
        '''
        Evaluates the model's classification accuracy using input images and labels.

        Parameters:
            X (np.array): Input images to be evaluated by the model.
            Y (np.array): True labels for the input images.
            plot (None or Str, optional): Assigns prediction error (pe) plotting behavior. None to plot nothing. 
                                Str can be 'first' to plot model response to first image, f'rand{N}' to plot responses to N random 
                                images, or 'all' for those of all images.

        Parameters:
            X (np.array): Input images for prediction.
            plot (None or Str, optional): Assigns topmost representation and prediction error (pe) plotting behavior. None to plot nothing. 
                                Str can be 'first' to plot model response to first image, f'rand{N}' to plot responses to N random
